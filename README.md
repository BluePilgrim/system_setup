# system_setup
Various files to set up the system

For my playing with Linux and related systems, various setup files or other stuffs should be kept to remove redundant operations.

Initially, I put some docker related files here.

# @ March 12, 2015
Linux setup information(specially for Gentoo Distro) has been added to the repository in a folder "linux_setup".

# @ July 6, 2015
Mesos-based cloud environment setup will be added.
